                <p class="founder-welcome">Welcome to the The Fresh Glorious College.As you tour our site, I hope you gain insight into the high quality of education we have to offer your ward.We recognize, appreciate and encourage the spirit of achievement in all our students. We, together with our parents and guardians work hard to help our students realize their full potential.</p>
                <p class="founder-welcome">Over the centuries and this century inclusive, Education has been accepted to be the bedrock of the development of any society. There is also no gain saying the fact in today`s modern society. Education has assumed a much more pivotal role in the overall development of the society.</p>
                <p class="founder-welcome">More so, it is now public knowledge that EDUCATION has played a central role in Wealth Creation, acquisition of skills and knowledge which have given birth to growth and development in today`s world.</p>
                <p class="founder-welcome">Acquisition of skills and knowledge and the resultant wealth have relegated natural resources to secondary position(s) in terms of wealth generation/creation for instance the richest man in the world is not an oil (petroleum oil) magnet/merchant but a computer giant by name Bill Gate. The above overview of the importance of EDUCATION is a reminder to parents, guardians and the general public that the society would be better off when EDUCATION is given its PRIDE of place in the society.</p>
